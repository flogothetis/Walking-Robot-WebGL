The task is to create a simple robot that walks and moves its arms and legs,
usingWebGL (http://www.khronos.org/webgl/) and JavaScript only. The
task is intended to demonstrate simple and fast cross-platform interactive
application development using state-of-the-art technologies.
SPECIFICALLY:

• The robot needs to be able to move left and right using the left
and right arrow keys respectively. The robot needs to be rotated
accordingly so it always faces the walking direction. The rotation
could be instant or gradual (frame per frame) - it is up to you. Both
are accepted as correct.

• While walking, the robot’s arms and legs should rotate around a
stable axis, simulating the movement of their real counterparts. For
example, while the left arm goes down, the right should go up and vice
versa. When the left leg goes forward, the right goes backwards and
so on...

When no keys are pressed, the robot stops moving and arms/legs stop
rotating.

Download:
Download the  full folder with libraries.And run the Robot.htm file on a 
browser.(I suggest Google Chrome Browser).Libraries and hmt file must be in the 
same folder

Thank you!
